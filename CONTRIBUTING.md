# Contributions!
for those of you who want to take a crack at furthering the development of this software here are a few rules, since "that is all the separates us from the animals." - John Wick
## Compatibility
I have no plans of even supporting Mac, as Apple is dead to me, so, if anyone wants to make a MacOS version of this I won't stop you, however, I will not be maintaining compatibility with it intentionally.
We will support Linux and Windows as first party operating systems, I will be creating a staging branch that will be used to test compilation to the first party operating systems before we push to main.
### Games
We want this to be generic enough for just about any game server to work under this program, however, Minecraft in particular is a first-party title, meaning that it **has** to work, as a disclaimer, I am not affiliated with Mojang, and I have no rights to the game and I also have no reason to be credited in the game
## Intellectual Property
as I have embarked on this alone with no funding support from any party, I, SturdyFool10 own this as my own property, this is open through the MIT License for everyone to use, but it is still my idea, and I would like it to be mine until the day I die. as people may be contributing, I will also credit everyone independently for their work, but by contributing you agree that in a legal sense, this project is still mine to do what I need to with, I officially plan to just stay independent and Open Source, which is the purpose of this clause: allowing the project to be its own thing.
# My Opinion on the Rust Foundation
Any discussion about project rights with Rust involved needs to touch on this: they have no control on this work under copyright law, and neither do the crate authors who have graciously provided advanced tooling for this project to use, that being said, this project is not for-profit not that it should matter to them anyway, if I had made the same thing in C++ I should be able to call it CppServerController for organization's sake, which is why this is called RustServerController: simple organization by project language

# how to contribute
Message me, because as of yet, we have no infrastructure for it, but I will make a staging branch and we can push your code there, then merge it with main once we are sure that the compatibility checks say things work, you will need to be able to compile and run the code on your own, and as a non-profit project I will not strictly speaking be "hiring" you, so do not expect payment
